      <p>Welcome Statement:</p>
      <p>
        Welcome to American Aussies, LLC! We breed AKC/ASCA Australian Shepherds. Our goal is to have well rounded family dogs, working dogs and show dogs. Our dogs are just
        simply Australian Shepherds we do not breed "Minnie" Australian Shepherds. We are extremely picky about our breeding stock that we bring into our program. Temperament 
        is huge. We do not allow aggressive dogs (or bloodlines) into our program. There are different drive levels with Aussies: low-high. We have all levels here but even 
        with our high drive dogs, they have an off switch. Our dogs are great with working all day on our farm or they are happy to be lap dogs for the day. All of our animals 
        are well socialized with both people and other animals from a young age. We also are a Texas Licensed and Inspected Kennel! We are here to answer questions anytime.

      <h3>Puppies</h3>
      <p>
        <p>We do not hold with out a deposit which is $500 and goes towards the total cost of the puppy. We constantly have our pre deposit list going for our puppies and we rarely make it off our list. 
          Our pre deposit list is the only way we do our waitlist and it is $500. Deposits are non refundable.</p>
        <p>Prices</p>
        <p>Our puppies are $2500 pet price/ limited registration plus tax regardless of color or gender. Breeding rights may be purchased for an additional $1000. If your puppy is dual registered with ASCA 
          then the ASCA registration fee's will be the buyers responsibility.</p>

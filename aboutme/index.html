        Hello all, As an introduction I will first tell you about my family. I am married to my lovely wife Heidi. We have five children that range from 6 to 29 years old. We have 2 girls and three boys. Our family recently moved from Washington State to the Great State of Texas! It was a  long haul with many adventures but we love our new home and feel like we fit right into the community.

        I have worked in the grocery industry as a Meat Market Manager for the last 22 years and am  pursuing a degree in Applied Technology with the desire to end up in the field of Cybersecurity. The thing that I have most loved about being a student at BYU Idaho has been the in depth required courses in religion as they have helped me in so many ways. Unfortunately I have finished all of the required courses and do not have the time to take extra courses not required for my degree. I am taking this course as an elective. I have finished all of the required courses for my major and minor certificates which were in Computer Programing, System Administration, and Computer Support but plan on using my electives to get more certificates in the IT field so that I am somewhat versed in many aspects of the IT world as a whole before I narrow my focus to any speciality. After all it all works together.

        I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints since I was baptized at 8 years old but I was inactive for about 30 years before becomeing active again for the last 14 years. One fo my favorite scriptures is Psalms 46:10 which helps me to remember who it is that is actually in control and remember to have faith in Him by stating "Be still and know that I am God."

        I look forward to this class and reinforcing some of the knowlege that I have learned throughout my studies. I am also looking forward to working with all of you and wish you all the best this semester.
